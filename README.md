<img align="right" width="260" src="/images/STIG_rev1.png"> Structured Threat Intelligence Graph (STIG) is a tool for creating, editing, querying, analyzing and visualizing threat intelligence. It uses STIX version 2 as its data format. STIG uses a graph database (Neo4j) to store the data.

See the [STIG Innovation Sheet](18-179_STIG_Innovation_Sheet.pdf) for an overview.

For installation and usage instructions, see our [documentation](https://stig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
